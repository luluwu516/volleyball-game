# Volleyball Game
I'm excited to present to you my latest creation, a volleyball serve-receive game that I made using Pygame. 

This game challenges you to catch as many balls as possible, testing your reaction time and agility. It's my very first game developed entirely by myself, and I'm thrilled to share it with you. So, put your skills to the test and see how many balls you can catch in this exciting volleyball game.

## How to play?
To use Pygame, Python is necessary. If Python is not installed on your computer, you can obtain it by downloading it from [python.org](https://www.python.org).

Once you have downloaded Python, the recommended method to install Pygame is by using the pip tool, which is the package manager that Python utilizes for package installations.

```
python -m pip install -U pygame==2.3.0 --user
```

After downloading all of the necessary files, you can execute the program by running the "main.py" file.


## Play the game!

To start the game, simply press any button, and then use the arrow keys to move your player around.

Be careful though, as the player only has three lives. If you miss the balls three times and lose all your lives, the game will come to an end.

If the ball is too far away from your player, you can press the space key to double the player's speed and quickly catch up to the ball. However, make sure to keep an eye on the player's SP (the yellow bar on the top left corner of the screen), as you'll need enough SP to use the jump or double speed features. Always ensure that the player has enough SP to perform the actions required to win the game.
